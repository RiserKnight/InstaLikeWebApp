# Winsta
This project is made by me for Infotrek22 event Websmith

In this project I will be using

FrontEnd - Html,CSS,JS
Backend and Server- NodeJS and Express
Database - PostgresSQl
ORM - Sequelize

In the root folder of app add .env file with content as
DB_PASS=205121002
SECRET=somesecrettext

where DB_PASS will be passoword of postgresSQL
and SECRET is secret key to store cookies

Iin Post upload section upload file will work fine although it will not show at front-end.
